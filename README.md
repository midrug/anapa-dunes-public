Contain Jupyter Notebook used for detection of structural lines (crest and toes) of dunes at Anapa bay-bar

Input file must contain cross-shore profiles, represented as set of points (look at sample file 'point_profile_10_5m.gpkg'). You can easily create such set of points from transects using SAGA GIS module "Profile from lines" (http://www.saga-gis.org/saga_tool_doc/2.2.5/ta_profiles_4.html)

Attribute table must have same structure, as in sample file.
